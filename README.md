# Noir Benchmarks
Benchmark `nargo prove` times of Noir programs spanning across different constraint counts (i.e. program sizes).

## Results

Existing results were gathered using:
- M2 Macbook Air
- Nargo v0.19.4 (paired with the default [barretenberg](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/master/barretenberg) proving backend)

Detailed results are available in the [`results`](./results/) folder.

## Run it yourself

To gather your own results, [install Nargo](https://noir-lang.org/getting_started/nargo_installation) and run from the project root:

```
bash scripts/info_and_prove_csv.sh
```

You can then find the results being printed into the CSV file under the [`results`](./results/) folder.

**Note:** The first run includes program compilations. Conduct a second run to obtain accurate benchmarks of `nargo prove` times.

## 2^n constraint counts

Ultraplonk-based barretenberg comes with stepped proving time and memory footprints per powers of 2 constraint counts. That is two Noir programs of 150,000 and 250,000 backend constraint counts respectively would cost similar time and memory to prove, as they both consists of >2^17 and â‰¤2^18 constraints.

The repository contains Noir programs of backend constraint counts from 2^2 to 2^24 as of Nargo v0.19.4 and its paired version of barretenberg.

You can run the following command at the project root to verify actual contraint counts of each example program:

```
nargo info --package {package_name e.g. 2^2}
```

You should then see the corresponding details printed to your console:

```
$ nargo info --package 2^2
